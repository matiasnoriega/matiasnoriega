# Hello there, i'm MatÃ­as ðŸ‘‹

### About me

I'm a software developer/problem solver currently studying for a Computer Science degree in my hometown's [university](http://www.uno.edu.ar) :mortar_board:. Once in a while I like to give GIT workshops to fellow classmates who haven't heard the version control benefits :raised_hands: and once a year collaborate with the local [FLISOL](https://flisol.info) organization.

### Nowdays

Iâ€™m currently working with PHP, Symfony and VueJS :wrench: but i'm always open to learn new technologies ðŸŒ±. Looking for open-source projects to contribute!
